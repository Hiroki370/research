Research on Clustering Algorithm based on Infomation Theory

Why clustering algorithm in marketing?
-> optimize marketing measures for each cluster

K-means:
	easy to understand the algorithm,
	but whether its output reflects useful information is doutful since K-Means considers only the distance of points.
	
My Research:
	Clustering based on Information Theory.
	Main Idea:
		Since Clustering is grouping "similar" points,
		the average of the entropy conditioned on a cluster should decrease.
		(This doesn't mean that any conditioned entropy should decrease.)
		-> optimize clustering by minimize conditioned entropy.
